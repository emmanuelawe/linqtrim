        You may ask Bitly not to associate your web browser or IP address with
        visits to the Bitly.com website or Bitly Links that you create or click
        by clicking on the appropriate links below. If you would like to opt-out
        of the Bitly Links, please click on the opt-out choice for Bitly Links
        below. This will install a cookie on your browser that instructs our
        servers not to associate your IP address and browser with Bitly Links
        you create, click, or view. If you clear your cookies in your browser,
        you will need to click on the opt- out choice again after each time you
        clear your cookies. To be clear, these cookie-based opt-outs must be
        performed on each device and browser that you wish to have opted-out.
        Cookie-based opt-outs are not effective on mobile applications. However,
        on many mobile devices, application users may limit tracking via their
        device settings. Please note that if you use these opt-out mechanisms,
        we will still automatically collect the IP addresses of computers or
        mobile devices that click on or create Bitly Links; we just won’t
        associate them with your browser or Bitly account. Cookies on Bitly.com:
