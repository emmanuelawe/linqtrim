        This Privacy Policy outlines how we collect, use, and share personal
        data of people who use or are connected to our services, are interested
        in Bitly or its services, or to whom we wish to market our services.
        This Privacy Policy also provides you with information on your rights as
        a data subject and how to reach us if you have any questions. This
        Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of other businesses that
        Bitly does not own or control, including other companies’ websites,
        services, and applications (“Third Party Services”) that you can access
        through the Services or to individuals that Bitly does not manage or
        employ. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of any Third
        Party Services you access or use. Please note that we cannot take
        responsibility for the content or privacy policies of Third Party
        Services, and any third party policies linked to this Privacy Policy are
        strictly for informational purposes only. Please note that our privacy
        practices are subject to the applicable laws of the regions in which we
        operate. Accordingly, some additional region-specific terms will only
        apply to individuals in those locations, or as required by applicable
        laws. If you are a United States resident of California, Virginia,
        Colorado, Connecticut, or certain other U.S. states, please see the
        sections titled California Privacy Rights, and
        Virginia/Colorado/Connecticut and certain other U.S. State Privacy
        Rights for specific disclosures with respect to our collection, use, and
        disclosure of your information and additional rights you have under
        applicable U.S. laws.
