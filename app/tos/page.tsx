        Bitly reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to modify or replace
        this Agreement at any time. If we modify this Agreement, we will post
        the modification on our site and update the “Last Updated” date at the
        top of the Terms of Use or provide you with notice of the modification
        in the Bitly platform. Any change to this Agreement will be effective as
        of the Last Updated Date in at the top of this page. By continuing to
        access or use the Bitly Services after the Last Updated Date, you are
        indicating that you agree to be bound by the modified Agreement. You
        agree that it is your responsibility to check this Agreement
        periodically for changes and that your use of the Bitly Services
        following the posting of any changes to this Agreement constitutes
        acceptance of those changes. If the modified Agreement is not acceptable
        to you, your only recourse is to cease using the Bitly Services. 1.2
        Service Changes. Bitly may add, remove, suspend, discontinue, modify or
        update the Bitly Services at any time, at its discretion. After the
        effective date of such a change, Bitly shall bear no obligation to run,
        provide or support legacy versions of any affected Bitly Services. 1.3
        Customer Support. Bitly provides a help center for all users. More
        details about additional support services can be found in the help
        center which is accessible through the platform. 2. PAID ACCOUNTS 2.1
        Fees. Bitly offers fee-based Bitly Services that provide additional
        features and functionality. If you sign up for a paid account, you agree
        to pay Bitly all applicable fees for the tier of Bitly Services
        according to your selection. Fees are non-refundable except as required
        by law or as otherwise specifically permitted in this Agreement. 2.2
        Subscription Period. Paid account plans will be charged the rate stated
        at the time of initial purchase on a recurring basis corresponding to
        the term of your subscription until you cancel. Fees are subject to
        change and Bitly will notify you of any pricing change prior to
        processing your next recurring charge. You may cancel your paid account
        subscription at any time, however, unless required by law, no refunds or
        credits will be provided for any early termination or for any non-use of
        the Bitly Services. Bitly reserves the right to update, change, modify
        or terminate your subscription benefits at any time in its sole
        discretion. 2.3 Payment. You will pay Bitly on the payment interval
        selected. If not otherwise specified, payments will be due immediately.
        You authorize Bitly to charge you for all applicable fees on a recurring
        basis using your selected payment method through Bitly’s online payments
        platform. By providing a saved payment method (“Payment Method”) in your
        account, you expressly acknowledge and authorize Bitly (or our third
        party online payment processor) to charge you on a recurring basis
        corresponding to the term of your subscription unless you cancel your
        paid account subscription. You are responsible for any and all fees
        charged to your Payment Method. You will provide complete and accurate
        billing and contact information to Bitly. Bitly may make changes to the
        offered Payment Method from time to time. It is your responsibility to
        update your payment information if necessary due to such changes. Bitly
        may suspend, downgrade or terminate the Services if Fees are past due.
        Unpaid Fees are subject to a finance charge of one percent (1.5%) per
        month (18% per annum), or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is
        lower. In addition, Bitly will be entitled to recover its expenses for
        collection, including reasonable attorneys’ fees. Failure to pay Fees or
        Renewal Fees when due may lead to termination, cancellation or
        suspension of Services. FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, BITLY MAY SUBMIT
        PERIODIC CHARGES CORRESPONDING TO THE TERM OF YOUR SELECTED SUBSCRIPTION
        WITHOUT FURTHER AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU AFFIRMATIVELY CANCEL
        YOUR SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES OR NOTIFY BITLY THAT YOU WISH TO CHANGE YOUR
        PAYMENT METHOD INFORMATION. 2.4 Taxes. Fees are exclusive of taxes,
        duties, levies, tariffs, and other governmental charges (collectively,
        “Taxes”), and you are responsible for all Taxes resulting from this
        Agreement or your use of the Bitly Services. Bitly will invoice you for
        Taxes when required to do so by applicable law, and you agree to provide
        payment under the terms of the invoice. In the event you are required by
        law to deduct and withhold any Taxes on amounts payable under this
        Agreement, any amounts required to be withheld will be promptly deducted
        and timely remitted by you on behalf of Bitly to the appropriate
        taxation authority and you agree that you will provide Bitly with copies
        of all necessary documents (including but not limited to tax receipts
        received from the applicable tax authority) in order for Bitly to claim
        and receive a foreign tax credit in an amount corresponding to the
        amount withheld by you. 3. USE OF SERVICES 3.1 Use of Bitly Services.
        Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and payment of all
        Fees due hereunder, Bitly grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable,
        limited right to access and use the Bitly Services in accordance with
        our Acceptable Use Policy. For the avoidance of any doubt, you agree
        that you will not access the Bitly Services for competitive purposes or
        if you are a competitor of Bitly. 3.2 Access Credentials. Bitly shall
        provide you with non-transferable access credentials for the Bitly
        Services. You will not share access credentials or exceed the user

        access credentials; (ii) select or use as a username or custom domain a
        name subject to any rights of a person or entity or any third party
        other than you without appropriate authorization; (iii) select or use,
        as your username or custom domain, a name that is otherwise offensive,
        vulgar or obscene or otherwise would violate our Acceptable Use Policy;
        or (iv) exceed any access permitted by Bitly. You will safeguard all
        access credentials provided by Bitly and shall ensure the
        confidentiality and security thereof. If you are a corporate entity
        rather than an individual (A) only your employees and authorized
        contractors (“Personnel”) may use the Bitly Services; (B) you will

        the use restrictions (including user seat restrictions) set out in the
        Agreement; (C) you will not share access credentials or exceed the user
        limitations of your service tier; and (D) you acknowledge that you will
        be fully responsible for any acts or omissions of your Personnel,
        whether authorized or unauthorized. Bitly may update, refresh or change
        the manner of accessing the Bitly Services at its discretion. 3.3
        Compliance Monitoring. Bitly may monitor your use of the Bitly Services
        for compliance with the Agreement, and to ensure compliance with our
        Acceptable Use Policy. If Bitly observes usage of the Bitly Services
        that it believes are not in compliance with the Agreement, Bitly may (i)
        remove or disable any linked, codes, or other Bitly Services that are
        suspected of violating our Acceptable Use Policy or this Agreement.
        Bitly reserves the right to suspend your use of the Bitly Services
        without notice in the event that we believe, in good faith, the security
        of your Bitly account has been compromised or your Bitly account is
        being used for an unlawful purpose or any purposes that violates our
        Acceptable Use policy. Bitly reserves the right to suspend your access
        to the Services or terminate this Agreement without notice for violation
        of the Agreement. 4. YOUR SERVICES AND CONTENT 4.1 Your Service. Bitly
