      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
        Linqtrim offers fee-based Linqtrim Services that provide additional features
        and functionality. If you sign up for a paid account, you agree to pay
        Linqtrim all applicable fees for the tier of Linqtrim Services according to
        your selection. Fees are non-refundable except as required by law or as
        otherwise specifically permitted in this Agreement.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2.2 Subscription Period</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
        Paid account plans will be charged the rate stated at the time of
        initial purchase on a recurring basis corresponding to the term of your
        subscription until you cancel. Fees are subject to change and Linqtrim will
        notify you of any pricing change prior to processing your next recurring
        charge. You may cancel your paid account subscription at any time,
        however, unless required by law, no refunds or credits will be provided
        for any early termination or for any non-use of the Linqtrim Services. Linqtrim
        reserves the right to update, change, modify or terminate your
        subscription benefits at any time in its sole discretion.
      </p>
      <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2.3 Payment</h3>
      <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6 text-justify">
        You will pay Linqtrim on the payment interval selected. If not otherwise
        specified, payments will be due immediately. You authorize Linqtrim to
        charge you for all applicable fees on a recurring basis using your
        selected payment method through Linqtrim’s online payments platform. By
        providing a saved payment method (“Payment Method”) in your account, you
        expressly acknowledge and authorize Linqtrim (or our third party online
        payment processor) to charge you on a recurring basis corresponding to
        the term of your subscription unless you cancel your paid account
        subscription. You are responsible for any and all fees charged to your
        Payment Method. You will provide complete and accurate billing and
        contact information to Linqtrim. Linqtrim may make changes to the offered
        Payment Method from time to time. It is your responsibility to update
        your payment information if necessary due to such changes. Linqtrim may
        suspend, downgrade or terminate the Services if Fees are past due. Unpaid
        Fees are subject to a finance charge of one percent (1.5%) per month (18%
        per annum), or the maximum permitted by law, whichever is lower. In
        addition, Linqtrim will be entitled to recover its expenses for collection,
        including reasonable attorneys’ fees. Failure to pay Fees or Renewal Fees
        when due may lead to termination, cancellation or suspension of Services.
        FOR THE AVOIDANCE OF DOUBT, LINQTRIM MAY SUBMIT PERIODIC CHARGES
        CORRESPONDING TO THE TERM OF YOUR SELECTED SUBSCRIPTION WITHOUT FURTHER
        AUTHORIZATION FROM YOU, UNTIL YOU AFFIRMATIVELY CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION
        SERVICES OR NOTIFY LINQTRIM THAT YOU WISH TO CHANGE YOUR PAYMENT METHOD
        INFORMATION.
