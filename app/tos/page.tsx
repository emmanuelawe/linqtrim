        use of the Linqtrim Services and constitute a binding legal agreement
        between you and Linqtrim. If you accept this Agreement or use the
        Linqtrim Services on behalf of a company or other legal entity, you
        represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind that company
        or other legal entity to the Agreement and, in such event, “you” “your”
        or “Customer” will refer and apply to that company or other legal
        entity. If you have been granted access to and use of the Linqtrim
        Services by and on behalf of the primary account holder, whether
        directly or through an administrator, you also agree to abide by this
